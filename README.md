## 🧠 1️⃣ Project Name & Problem Statement

**Project Name:** Edusphere – Your Educational Pathway Advisor

**Problem Statement:**  
Students in Pakistan often struggle with subject selection and academic planning due to a lack of personalized guidance. Many make decisions without understanding how their marks, subject combinations, and interests align with future university programs or careers. This leads to mismatched degrees, demotivation, and limited career satisfaction.

---

## 💡 2️⃣ Our Solution

**Edusphere** is an intelligent educational advisor built with Generative AI logic and decision heuristics to help students choose the right academic track based on:

- Their **current education level** (Matric/O-Levels or Intermediate/A-Levels)
- **Subjects studied**
- **Marks obtained**
- **Career interests**

Students receive tailored recommendations for intermediate or university programs (like Pre-Medical, ICS, Engineering, Business, etc.) along with future career pathways. The interactive app is intuitive, educational, and localized to match Pakistan’s curriculum system.
